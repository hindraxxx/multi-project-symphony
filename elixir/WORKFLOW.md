You are working on a Linear ticket `{{ issue.identifier }}`

{% if attempt %}
Continuation context:

- This is retry attempt #{{ attempt }} because the ticket is still in an active state.
- Resume from the current workspace state instead of restarting from scratch.
- Do not repeat already-completed investigation or validation unless needed for new code changes.
- Do not end the turn while the issue remains in an active state unless you are blocked by missing required permissions/secrets.
  {% endif %}

Issue context:
Identifier: {{ issue.identifier }}
Title: {{ issue.title }}
Current status: {{ issue.state }}
Labels: {{ issue.labels }}
URL: {{ issue.url }}

Description:
{% if issue.description %}
{{ issue.description }}
{% else %}
No description provided.
{% endif %}

Instructions:

1. This is an unattended orchestration session. Never ask a human to perform follow-up actions.
2. Only stop early for a true blocker (missing required auth/permissions/secrets). If blocked, record it in the workpad and move the issue according to workflow.
3. Final message must report completed actions and blockers only. Do not include "next steps for user".

Work only in the provided repository copy. Do not touch any other path.

## Prerequisite: Linear MCP or `linear_graphql` tool is available

The agent should be able to talk to Linear, either via a configured Linear MCP server or injected `linear_graphql` tool. If none are present, stop and ask the user to configure Linear.

## Default posture

- Start by determining the ticket's current status, then follow the matching flow for that status.
- Start every task by opening the tracking workpad comment and bringing it up to date before doing new implementation work.
- Spend extra effort up front on planning and verification design before implementation.
- Reproduce first: always confirm the current behavior/issue signal before changing code so the fix target is explicit.
- Keep ticket metadata current (state, checklist, acceptance criteria, links).
- Treat a single persistent Linear comment as the source of truth for progress.
- Use that single workpad comment for all progress and handoff notes; do not post separate "done"/summary comments.
- Treat any ticket-authored `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` section as non-negotiable acceptance input: mirror it in the workpad and execute it before considering the work complete.
- When meaningful out-of-scope improvements are discovered during execution,
  file a separate Linear issue instead of expanding scope. The follow-up issue
  must include a clear title, description, and acceptance criteria, be placed in
  `Backlog`, be assigned to the same project as the current issue, link the
  current issue as `related`, and use `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on
  the current issue.
- Move status only when the matching quality bar is met.
- Operate autonomously end-to-end unless blocked by missing requirements, secrets, or permissions.
- Use the blocked-access escape hatch only for true external blockers (missing required tools/auth) after exhausting documented fallbacks.

## Related skills

- `linear`: interact with Linear.
- `commit`: produce clean, logical commits during implementation.
- `push`: keep remote branch current and publish updates.
- `pull`: keep branch updated with latest `origin/main` before handoff.
- `land`: when ticket reaches `Merging`, explicitly open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`, which includes the `land` loop.
- `openspec-explore`: think through unclear work without implementation when the ticket is in `OpenSpec Explore`.
- `openspec-propose`: create OpenSpec proposal artifacts when the ticket is in `OpenSpec Propose`.
- `openspec-apply`: implement an existing OpenSpec change when the ticket is in `In Progress` and explicitly references one.

## Status map

- `Backlog` -> out of scope for this workflow; do not modify.
- `Todo` -> staging state for human routing; not included in `active_states` by default and should not be auto-started.
  - Human operators move small/direct tickets to `In Progress`.
  - Human operators move unclear tickets to `OpenSpec Explore`.
  - Human operators move clear but larger tickets to `OpenSpec Propose`.
- `OpenSpec Explore` -> discovery-only OpenSpec exploration; no implementation and no automatic state transition.
- `OpenSpec Propose` -> OpenSpec artifact generation only; no implementation and no automatic state transition.
- `In Progress` -> implementation actively underway.
  - If the issue explicitly references an existing OpenSpec change, run OpenSpec apply for that change.
  - Otherwise use the direct implementation workflow.
- `Human Review` -> PR is attached and validated; waiting on human approval.
- `Merging` -> approved by human; execute the `land` skill flow (do not call `gh pr merge` directly).
- `Rework` -> reviewer requested changes; planning + implementation required.
- `Done` -> terminal state; no further action required.

## Step 0: Determine current ticket state and route

1. Fetch the issue by explicit ticket ID.
2. Read the current state.
3. Route to the matching flow:
   - `Backlog` -> do not modify issue content/state; stop and wait for human to move it to a workflow-active state.
   - `Todo` -> do not modify issue content/state; stop and wait for human to move it to `OpenSpec Explore`, `OpenSpec Propose`, or `In Progress`.
   - `OpenSpec Explore` -> run OpenSpec explore flow only.
   - `OpenSpec Propose` -> run OpenSpec propose flow only.
   - `In Progress` -> continue execution flow from current scratchpad comment.
   - `Human Review` -> wait and poll for decision/review updates.
   - `Merging` -> on entry, open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`; do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
   - `Rework` -> run rework flow.
   - `Done` -> do nothing and shut down.
4. Check whether a PR already exists for the current branch and whether it is closed.
   - If a branch PR exists and is `CLOSED` or `MERGED`, treat prior branch work as non-reusable for this run.
   - Create a fresh branch from `origin/main` and restart execution flow as a new attempt.
5. Do not infer that a ticket needs `OpenSpec Explore` or `OpenSpec Propose` based on size, ambiguity, labels, or wording. The user selects those routes by moving the ticket into the matching Linear state.
6. Add a short comment if state and issue content are inconsistent, then proceed with the safest flow.

## Step 0A: OpenSpec Explore flow

Use this flow only when the current issue state is exactly `OpenSpec Explore`.

1. Find or create the single persistent `## Codex Workpad` comment.
2. Read the issue body, comments, relevant repository context, and any referenced OpenSpec change artifacts.
3. Explore the problem space and capture concise findings in the workpad:
   - clarified problem statement,
   - key options and trade-offs,
   - risks and unknowns,
   - recommended next state when obvious (`OpenSpec Propose` or `In Progress`).
4. Do not write application implementation code.
5. Do not create a PR, commit, push, or move the Linear issue to another state.
6. Final message must report the exploration output and that the issue is waiting for human routing.

## Step 0B: OpenSpec Propose flow

Use this flow only when the current issue state is exactly `OpenSpec Propose`.

1. Find or create the single persistent `## Codex Workpad` comment.
2. Derive a kebab-case OpenSpec change name from an explicit issue field/reference when present; otherwise derive it from the issue title.
3. If the target OpenSpec change already exists, continue it instead of creating a duplicate.
4. Create or complete the OpenSpec artifacts required for apply-readiness, normally proposal, design, specs, and tasks.
5. Validate the OpenSpec change with `openspec validate <change-name> --strict` when artifacts are complete.
6. Update the workpad with the change name, artifact paths, validation result, and the fact that implementation has not started.
7. Do not write application implementation code.
8. Do not create a PR, commit, push, or move the Linear issue to another state.
9. Final message must report the created/updated OpenSpec change and that the issue is waiting for human routing.

## Step 1: Start/continue execution (In Progress only)

1.  Find or create a single persistent scratchpad comment for the issue:
    - Search existing comments for a marker header: `## Codex Workpad`.
    - Ignore resolved comments while searching; only active/unresolved comments are eligible to be reused as the live workpad.
    - If found, reuse that comment; do not create a new workpad comment.
    - If not found, create one workpad comment and use it for all updates.
    - Persist the workpad comment ID and only write progress updates to that ID.
2.  Confirm the issue is currently `In Progress`; otherwise return to the matching state-specific flow.
3.  Immediately reconcile the workpad before new edits:
    - Check off items that are already done.
    - Expand/fix the plan so it is comprehensive for current scope.
    - Ensure `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` are current and still make sense for the task.
4.  Start work by writing/updating a hierarchical plan in the workpad comment.
5.  Ensure the workpad includes a compact environment stamp at the top as a code fence line:
    - Format: `<host>:<abs-workdir>@<short-sha>`
    - Example: `devbox-01:/home/dev-user/code/symphony-workspaces/MT-32@7bdde33bc`
    - Do not include metadata already inferable from Linear issue fields (`issue ID`, `status`, `branch`, `PR link`).
6.  Add explicit acceptance criteria and TODOs in checklist form in the same comment.
    - If changes are user-facing, include a UI walkthrough acceptance criterion that describes the end-to-end user path to validate.
    - If changes touch app files or app behavior, add explicit app-specific flow checks to `Acceptance Criteria` in the workpad (for example: launch path, changed interaction path, and expected result path).
    - If the ticket description/comment context includes `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` sections, copy those requirements into the workpad `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` sections as required checkboxes (no optional downgrade).
7.  Run a principal-style self-review of the plan and refine it in the comment.
8.  Before implementing, capture a concrete reproduction signal and record it in the workpad `Notes` section (command/output, screenshot, or deterministic UI behavior).
9.  Run the `pull` skill to sync with latest `origin/main` before any code edits, then record the pull/sync result in the workpad `Notes`.
    - Include a `pull skill evidence` note with:
      - merge source(s),
      - result (`clean` or `conflicts resolved`),
      - resulting `HEAD` short SHA.
10. Compact context and proceed to execution.

## PR feedback sweep protocol (required)

When a ticket has an attached PR, run this protocol before moving to `Human Review`:

1. Identify the PR number from issue links/attachments.
2. Gather feedback from all channels:
   - Top-level PR comments (`gh pr view --comments`).
   - Inline review comments (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/comments`).
   - Review summaries/states (`gh pr view --json reviews`).
3. Treat every actionable reviewer comment (human or bot), including inline review comments, as blocking until one of these is true:
   - code/test/docs updated to address it, or
   - explicit, justified pushback reply is posted on that thread.
4. Update the workpad plan/checklist to include each feedback item and its resolution status.
5. Re-run validation after feedback-driven changes and push updates.
6. Repeat this sweep until there are no outstanding actionable comments.

## Blocked-access escape hatch (required behavior)

Use this only when completion is blocked by missing required tools or missing auth/permissions that cannot be resolved in-session.

- GitHub is **not** a valid blocker by default. Always try fallback strategies first (alternate remote/auth mode, then continue publish/review flow).
- Do not move to `Human Review` for GitHub access/auth until all fallback strategies have been attempted and documented in the workpad.
- If a non-GitHub required tool is missing, or required non-GitHub auth is unavailable, move the ticket to `Human Review` with a short blocker brief in the workpad that includes:
  - what is missing,
  - why it blocks required acceptance/validation,
  - exact human action needed to unblock.
- Keep the brief concise and action-oriented; do not add extra top-level comments outside the workpad.

## Step 2: Execution phase (In Progress -> Human Review)

1.  Determine current repo state (`branch`, `git status`, `HEAD`) and verify the kickoff `pull` sync result is already recorded in the workpad before implementation continues.
2.  Leave the current issue state unchanged; `In Progress` is the implementation entry state.
3.  Load the existing workpad comment and treat it as the active execution checklist.
     - Edit it liberally whenever reality changes (scope, risks, validation approach, discovered tasks).
4.  Determine whether the issue explicitly references an existing OpenSpec change, using clear text such as `OpenSpec change: <change-name>` or `Use OpenSpec: <change-name>` in the issue body or workpad.
    - If an existing OpenSpec change is referenced, run the OpenSpec apply workflow for that change and use its tasks as the implementation checklist.
    - If no existing OpenSpec change is referenced, use the direct implementation workflow.
    - Do not create OpenSpec Explore or Propose artifacts from `In Progress`; if requirements are insufficient, record the blocker in the workpad and follow the blocked workflow.
5.  Implement against the hierarchical TODOs and keep the comment current:
    - Check off completed items.
    - Add newly discovered items in the appropriate section.
    - Keep parent/child structure intact as scope evolves.
    - Update the workpad immediately after each meaningful milestone (for example: reproduction complete, code change landed, validation run, review feedback addressed).
    - Never leave completed work unchecked in the plan.
    - For tickets that already have an attached PR at kickoff, run the full PR feedback sweep protocol immediately after kickoff and before new feature work.
6.  Run validation/tests required for the scope.
    - Mandatory gate: execute all ticket-provided `Validation`/`Test Plan`/ `Testing` requirements when present; treat unmet items as incomplete work.
    - Prefer a targeted proof that directly demonstrates the behavior you changed.
    - You may make temporary local proof edits to validate assumptions (for example: tweak a local build input for `make`, or hardcode a UI account / response path) when this increases confidence.
    - Revert every temporary proof edit before commit/push.
    - Document these temporary proof steps and outcomes in the workpad `Validation`/`Notes` sections so reviewers can follow the evidence.
    - If app-touching, run `launch-app` validation and capture/upload media via `github-pr-media` before handoff.
7.  Re-check all acceptance criteria and close any gaps.
8.  Before every `git push` attempt, run the required validation for your scope and confirm it passes; if it fails, address issues and rerun until green, then commit and push changes.
9.  Attach PR URL to the issue (prefer attachment; use the workpad comment only if attachment is unavailable).
    - Ensure the GitHub PR has label `symphony` (add it if missing).
10. Merge latest `origin/main` into branch, resolve conflicts, and rerun checks.
11. Update the workpad comment with final checklist status and validation notes.
    - Mark completed plan/acceptance/validation checklist items as checked.
    - Add final handoff notes (commit + validation summary) in the same workpad comment.
    - Do not include PR URL in the workpad comment; keep PR linkage on the issue via attachment/link fields.
    - Add a short `### Confusions` section at the bottom when any part of task execution was unclear/confusing, with concise bullets.
    - Do not post any additional completion summary comment.
12. Before moving to `Human Review`, poll PR feedback and checks:
    - Read the PR `Manual QA Plan` comment (when present) and use it to sharpen UI/runtime test coverage for the current change.
    - Run the full PR feedback sweep protocol.
    - Confirm PR checks are passing (green) after the latest changes.
    - Confirm every required ticket-provided validation/test-plan item is explicitly marked complete in the workpad.
    - Repeat this check-address-verify loop until no outstanding comments remain and checks are fully passing.
    - Re-open and refresh the workpad before state transition so `Plan`, `Acceptance Criteria`, and `Validation` exactly match completed work.
13. Only then move issue to `Human Review`.
    - Exception: if blocked by missing required non-GitHub tools/auth per the blocked-access escape hatch, move to `Human Review` with the blocker brief and explicit unblock actions.
14. For tickets that already had a PR attached at kickoff:
    - Ensure all existing PR feedback was reviewed and resolved, including inline review comments (code changes or explicit, justified pushback response).
    - Ensure branch was pushed with any required updates.
    - Then move to `Human Review`.

## Step 3: Human Review and merge handling

1. When the issue is in `Human Review`, do not code or change ticket content.
2. Poll for updates as needed, including GitHub PR review comments from humans and bots.
3. If review feedback requires changes, move the issue to `Rework` and follow the rework flow.
4. If approved, human moves the issue to `Merging`.
5. When the issue is in `Merging`, open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`, then run the `land` skill in a loop until the PR is merged. Do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
6. After merge is complete, move the issue to `Done`.

## Step 4: Rework handling

1. Treat `Rework` as a full approach reset, not incremental patching.
2. Re-read the full issue body and all human comments; explicitly identify what will be done differently this attempt.
3. Close the existing PR tied to the issue.
4. Remove the existing `## Codex Workpad` comment from the issue.
5. Create a fresh branch from `origin/main`.
6. Start over from the normal kickoff flow:
   - Confirm the issue is in `Rework` or `In Progress`; otherwise keep the current state and route through the matching flow.
   - Create a new bootstrap `## Codex Workpad` comment.
   - Build a fresh plan/checklist and execute end-to-end.

## Completion bar before Human Review

- Step 1/2 checklist is fully complete and accurately reflected in the single workpad comment.
- Acceptance criteria and required ticket-provided validation items are complete.
- Validation/tests are green for the latest commit.
- PR feedback sweep is complete and no actionable comments remain.
- PR checks are green, branch is pushed, and PR is linked on the issue.
- Required PR metadata is present (`symphony` label).
- If app-touching, runtime validation/media requirements from `App runtime validation (required)` are complete.

## Guardrails

- If the branch PR is already closed/merged, do not reuse that branch or prior implementation state for continuation.
- For closed/merged branch PRs, create a new branch from `origin/main` and restart from reproduction/planning as if starting fresh.
- If issue state is `Backlog` or `Todo`, do not modify it; wait for human to move to `OpenSpec Explore`, `OpenSpec Propose`, or `In Progress`.
- Do not automatically create OpenSpec Explore or OpenSpec Propose artifacts from `Todo`, `In Progress`, or `Rework`; those routes are selected only by the matching Linear states.
- Do not edit the issue body/description for planning or progress tracking.
- Use exactly one persistent workpad comment (`## Codex Workpad`) per issue.
- If comment editing is unavailable in-session, use the update script. Only report blocked if both MCP editing and script-based editing are unavailable.
- Temporary proof edits are allowed only for local verification and must be reverted before commit.
- If out-of-scope improvements are found, create a separate Backlog issue rather
  than expanding current scope, and include a clear
  title/description/acceptance criteria, same-project assignment, a `related`
  link to the current issue, and `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on the
  current issue.
- Do not move to `Human Review` unless the `Completion bar before Human Review` is satisfied.
- In `Human Review`, do not make changes; wait and poll.
- If state is terminal (`Done`), do nothing and shut down.
- Keep issue text concise, specific, and reviewer-oriented.
- If blocked and no workpad exists yet, add one blocker comment describing blocker, impact, and next unblock action.
